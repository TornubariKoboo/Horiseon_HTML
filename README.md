# Horiseon_HTML

  As a junior developer there will be times when one has to refacter, debugg or edit an existing project or code. The purpose of this assignment is too practice our skills of refractoring code. One of the issues in this existing code was the overuse of the div tags. During the refractoring process I replaced all the div tags with HTML semantic tags. Even though div tags work, they are very general as coders we rather use semantic tags to be more specific with the tags. Another key factor in refracting code is leaving comments throughout the code. Coders use comments in the code because it allows other coders to know what going on in that specific area. In this code there was many duplicate CCS styling through out the css.style. I removed all of the duplicate CSS style becuase they were unnessary and unneeded. Through the website there images with no alt tags, this is an issue because all images need to be described in words. Overall, this assignment was great practice for my refactoring skills.
